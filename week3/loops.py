"""
Write a program (remember that programs have a main() function) to print the lyrics of the song "Old MacDonalds." Your program should print the lyrics for five different animals (five verses), similar to the example verse below:
"""

# Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
# And on that farm he had a cow, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!
# With a moo, moo here and a moo, moo there.
# Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo, moo.
# Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-igh, ee-igh, oh!

    """Implement a function that prompts a 
	user for a password until the actual 
	password is entered and the user is 
	authenticated.

	Step 2: allow a maximum of three attempts.
